## Problem 1

Get 2017 Central park data from the web
```{r}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:

Write our very simple linear model, using tmax as the outcome and tmin as the predictor. We'll write a function to extract the two values we're interested in, r^2 and log(beta0hat * beta1hat)
```{r}
weather_fit <- lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = weather_df)

value_extract <- function(model) {
  r_squared <- model |>
    broom::glance() |>
    select(r.squared) |>
    pull()
  
  beta0 <- model |>
    broom::tidy() |>
    filter(term == "(Intercept)") |>
    select(estimate) |>
    pull()
  
  beta1 <- model |>
    broom::tidy() |>
    filter(term == "tmin") |>
    select(estimate) |>
    pull()
  
  output <- tibble(r_squared = r_squared,
                   log_beta0_beta1 = log(beta0 * beta1))
  return(output)
}

value_extract(weather_fit)
```

plot of this model
```{r}
weather_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```



𝑟̂ 2
log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)


Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for 𝑟̂ 2
 and log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)
. Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting 𝑟̂ 2
 from a fitted regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should help in computing log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)

Bootstrap 5000 times
```{r}
boot_results <- weather_df |>
  modelr::bootstrap(5000) |>
  mutate(strap = map(strap, as_tibble),
         models = map(strap, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = df)),
         results = map(models, value_extract)) |>
  select(.id, results) |>
  unnest(results) 
```

Plot these distributions
```{r}
boot_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = r_squared)) +
  geom_density()

boot_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = log_beta0_beta1)) +
  geom_density()
```


2.5% and 97.5% quantiles (i.e. 95% CI) for these values.
```{r}
boot_results |>
  pivot_longer(cols  = -.id, 
               names_to = "var",
               values_to = "value") |>
  group_by(var) |>
  summarize(boot_est = mean(value),
            boot_ci_ll = quantile(value, 0.025),
            boot_ci_ul = quantile(value, 0.975))
```


## Problem 2

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You can read their accompanying article here.

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

First importing the data, and doing some data cleaning to ensure that we have only valid data. We're only interested in white or black race, so we will also filter based on that.
```{r}
homicide_df <- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city,", ",state),
         solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest",TRUE, FALSE),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |>
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX",
                            "Phoenix, AZ",
                            "Kansas City, MO",
                            "Tulsa, OK"),
         victim_race %in% c("White","Black"))
```


For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.
```{r}
baltimore_fit <- glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
                     family = binomial,
                     data = homicide_df)

broom::tidy(baltimore_fit) |>
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate))

confint(baltimore_fit) |> exp()
```


Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.
